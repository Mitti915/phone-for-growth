Hi Amma and Appa! 
I’m going to high school next year, and I believe a phone can support my learning, especially since I’m interested in the tech field. 
It’s not just about messaging or fun. It’s about using tools that can help me grow and stay ahead in something I’m passionate about.
Also, don’t worry — I’m not asking for the newest iPhone or anything fancy. Even an older model, like the iPhone 10, would be totally fine. I just need something that works and gives me access to the tools and apps that can help me learn and explore technology better.
Phones are super helpful for learning tech. I can use coding apps to practice writing code when I’m not near my laptop. I can watch short tutorials, research how to fix errors, and even use cloud-based tools so I can continue my projects wherever I go. If I start something on my phone, I can finish it on my laptop later, and it’ll all be saved.
There are also tech-related groups and forums online that I could join. Being part of those lets me ask questions, learn from others, and stay updated on new skills — and it’s just easier to connect with those communities from a phone instead of borrowing yours or using my computer for every little thing.
Even my best friend’s brother, who’s studying computer science, said phones can be a smart way to start learning how to manage tech responsibly. It’s about practicing balance — something I really want to learn and show I can handle.
Right now, I only have an Apple Watch, and the screen is too small. Reading messages or trying to use it for anything tech-related just strains my eyes. Honestly, I think it’s worse for my eyes than my laptop’s small screen. A phone would be more practical, more useful, and even better for my health when it comes to learning.
I know you may be wondering if I’m just saying this to convince you, but I found real evidence to support everything I’m saying. The Joyce University of Nursing explains that smartphones help students stay organized, learn better, and communicate more easily. Their article says students use phones to access digital textbooks, take notes, and use learning apps. All of these support time management and effectiveness. So this shows that phones can help with learning when used the right way.
Also, I won’t let it distract me. Since I won’t have it on me while eating or finishing homework, I’ll stay focused and make sure my responsibilities come first. I understand that balance is important, and I’m committed to using the phone in a smart, respectful way — not as a distraction, but as a tool to help me grow.
Thank you!
